Be flexible with branches
  1. Add changes to index.js at top and bottom. show how to stage individual changes
  2. Stash apply a change to master after writing it in branch
  3. cherry-pick a change from branch into master
  4. Special case (new file)

Merge your branch!
  5. Merge Master into branch!
  6. Abort!
  7. Continue then UNDO!
  8. Rebase branch on Master
  9. Abort!
  10. Continue then Undo!

Getting your branch into master!  
  Merge vs Rebase

Moving between branches without fear:
  git stash, git stash apply, commit change into master
  git commit, git stash cherry-pick commit from branch to master, git stash apply


  How to update your feature branch with merge!
    git merge
    git reset --merge

  How to update your feature branch with rebase!
    git rebase
    git rebase --continue
    git rebase --abort

  Creating a new file in the wrong branch!?!?
    See 4 above. Don't stage or stash it just clear other uncommited changes and change your branch

  Reset a bad merge  
    git reset --hard HEAD^ or HEAD^2?
  
  Reset a bad rebase/commit and dump it into staging
    git reset --soft HEAD~1

  Reset a bad branch rebase (when used as merge)
    git reflog
    git reset --hard HEAD@{"prior to start of rebase"}
